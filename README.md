Retirement Notice
=================

This project is retired and no longer maintained. 

ITMill/Vaadin toolkit is a very mature product nowadays and with a lot of 3-rd party plugins and extensions. TPT was initially created to cover the missing pieces
and simplify the life of a early Vaadin users. Right now there are much more better extensions present in the Vaadin Directory so I encourage you to go there
and grab one(s) to fulfill your needs.

WHAT IS THIS
============
Toolkit Productivity Tools aka TPT is a small server-ide extension to the Vaadin framework and aims
to provide extended components, utilities and helpers that increases productivity when creating
Vaadin applications. TPT was born after I've managed to create several Vaadin-based production
applications and noticed that a number of small same things are commonly used in all apps
and can be extracted to a common library to boost the productivity and eliminate code duplicates.
